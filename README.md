# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects I have implemented. Each project focuses on different aspects of machine learning and demonstrates various techniques and algorithms.

## Projects

1. [Image Classification](./Image%20Classification/): MINST Number classification with TensorFlow.
   - This is an image classification project, this project will show you how to build the model from scratch, how to prepare the data, define the callback for early stopping when training the data, etc.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/soulking123/Machine-Learning-Project.git
